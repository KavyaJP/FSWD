# Learning the MERN Stack 🚀

Welcome to my journey of learning the **MERN Stack** – a powerful set of technologies for building full-stack web applications using JavaScript.

---

## 🧠 What is the MERN Stack?

- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **Express.js** – Minimalist web framework for Node.js to build APIs.
- **React.js** – Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime for server-side development.

Together, these technologies let you build **end-to-end web applications** using JavaScript only – from the database all the way to the user interface.
